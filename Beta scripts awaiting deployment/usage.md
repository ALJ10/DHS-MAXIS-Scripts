This folder is for placing script files that are ready for use, but awaiting some type of event.

Events may include:

1. Approval from state policy folks that the script does what we want it to do
2. A code freeze to end, such as those taking place the last week of the month while beta counties report new bugs
3. Other things that I can't think of right now

When the time is right, Veronica will move scripts from this folder to the main Script Files folder.
