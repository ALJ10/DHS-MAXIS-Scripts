MAXIS-BZ-Scripts
================

BlueZone Scripts for the MAXIS program.

BlueZone Scripts are a simple extension of the BlueZone software that counties and the state use to connect to MAXIS, MMIS, PRISM, and InfoPac. These scripts automate repetitive, simple tasks such as processing DAIL messages, adding/updating MAXIS panels, and generating accurate case notes.

These tools have the potential to save hundreds of hours of worker time per month, as well as reduce errors, provide detailed statistics, and promote standardization across workers, units, and counties. 

This repo will focus on the development of shared MAXIS-related scripts. The project lead is Veronica Cary, and she can be easily reached at veronica.cary@state.mn.us.
